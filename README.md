# Earth System Metrics and Diagnostics Standards (EMDS)

The Earth System Metrics and Diagnostics Standards provide guidance for the design of Earth system model evaluation software. There are requirements for the software interface, metadata, and metrics output format that are designed to promote interoperability of software packages and reproducibility of results. 

## Standards document
The Earth System Metrics and Diagnostics Standards can be accessed in this repository at [standards.md](standards.md). 

## Projects
Projects that make use of these standards include [Coordinated Model Evaluation Capabilities (CMEC)](https://cmec.llnl.gov/) and [NOAA Model Diagnostics Task Force (MDTF)](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/mdtf-diagnostics/).
