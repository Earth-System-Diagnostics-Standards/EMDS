# Earth System Metrics and Diagnostics Standards (EMDS)

The Earth System Metrics and Diagnostics Standards serve as a guidance document for the design of Earth system metrics and diagnostics based software utilities. The standards document provides requirements for software interfaces, metadata, and metrics output format that are designed to promote the interoperability of software packages and reproducibility of results.  

## Standards document
The Earth System Metrics and Diagnostics Standards can be accessed in this repository at [standards.md](standards.md). 

## Projects
Projects that make use of these standards include [Coordinated Model Evaluation Capabilities (CMEC)](https://cmec.llnl.gov/) and [NOAA Model Diagnostics Task Force (MDTF)](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/mdtf-diagnostics/).
